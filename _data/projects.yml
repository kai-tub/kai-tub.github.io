    summary:  >
      This repository provides a GitHub action to push files/binaries to external repositories. 
      Per default, the action uses the wiki of the current repo, but you can specify other repos as well. 
      This allows you to generate documentation/images/gifs in your CI pipeline and save these large binaries somewhere else, 
      keeping your code repository clean and small!
